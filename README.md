### AtliQ-Hardware-Project 

# Project Overview
Atliq Hardware is a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India with a significant international footprint. The company specializes in the sale of computers and related accessories. Despite their market presence, the management identified a gap in timely access to data-driven insights crucial for swift and informed decision-making.

To address this, the Data Analytics Director aimed to expand the analytics team and introduced an SQL-based challenge as part of the recruitment process. The challenge focused on solving 10 specific ad hoc business requests using real company data.

# Objective
To evaluate and deliver insights for 10 ad hoc business problems by:

Writing efficient SQL queries to extract and analyze data.

Visualizing results using Power BI.

Presenting actionable insights through a well-structured PowerPoint presentation tailored for senior management.

# Database Overview
The analysis was performed on the gdb0041 (atliq_hardware_db) database, which contains the following key tables:

dim_customer: Customer information.

dim_product: Product details.

fact_forecast_monthly: Product-level monthly forecasted expenses.

fact_fridge_cost: Details on fridge percentage and other costs.

fact_gross_price: Gross pricing information of products.

fact_manufacturing_cost: Manufacturing costs for each product.

fact_pre_invoice_deductions: Deductions applied before invoicing.

fact_post_invoice_deductions: Deductions applied after invoicing.

fact_sales_monthly: Monthly sales data.

# Approach
